# Loan-Eligibility-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Loan eligibility refers to the criteria that individuals or businesses must meet in order 
to be considered for a loan from a financial institution such as a bank, credit union, 
or online lender. These criteria typically include factors such as credit score, income, 
employment status, debt-to-income ratio, and collateral. Loan eligibility is an 
important consideration for both lenders and borrowers. Lenders need to assess the 
creditworthiness of potential borrowers in order to manage their risk and ensure that 
loans are paid back on time. Borrowers, on the other hand, need to understand the 
requirements for loan eligibility so that they can improve their chances of being 
approved for a loan.
